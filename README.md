## Notes

* SAM is much more buggy than CDK. For example when building the GraphQL API, it provided no validation and required a trial deployment to work out if the stack was going to deploy or not.
* Updates for stacks would be SOOOOO nice - not having to tear LocalStack down because updates don't work properly would speed up development so much.
